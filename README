* DAEMON

Fed up trying to configure a finger daemon just to serve Thimbl plans?
Then look in directory daemon, which contains the simplest solution to
the problem.

* PREREQUISITES

To generate the documentation on slackware, you will need to use sbopkg to install docutils.

* TIPS

** To print the rst files as man pages:
rst2man.py <thimbl.rst | groff -man -Tascii | less

** To pretty-print json strings:
echo '{"foo": "lorem", "bar": "ipsum"}' | python -mjson.tool

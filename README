Thimbl is a set of client-side tools for a distributed open source
microblogging platform. Thimbl-CLI is a set of command-line tools, and
is more modest in its ambitions than the whole of the Thimbl project.

Thimbl-CLI requires Linux/cygwin. It also includes the simplest
possible finger daemon to serve your tweets.

QUICKSTART

Thimbl-CLI is pretty much ready to go out of the box client-side.

Set up your profile:
   thimbl setup mcarter@markcarter.me.uk "Just a guy" \
      "Mark Carter" "www.markcarter.me.uk" "N/A" "info@markcarter.me.uk"
Create a post:
   thimbl post "First post"
Follow someone: 
   thimbl follow "dk" "dk@telekommunisten.net"
Fetch messages of people you are following:
   thimbl fetch
Print messages (including your own):
  thimbl print

Look in the doc folder for a more complete manual on Thimbl-CLI, which
contains the main documentation effort.




* DAEMON

Fed up trying to configure a finger daemon just to serve Thimbl plans?
Then look in directory daemon, which contains the simplest solution to
the problem.
